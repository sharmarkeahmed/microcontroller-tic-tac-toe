/* ---- PREPROCESSOR DIRECTIVES ----
IMPORTANT:
Two particle photons are required to use this firmware to play a game. One player will be player one,
another player will be player two. The preprocessor directives must be used to choose which particle
photon is player 1 and player 2 respectively. The define statement is used to pick what player is which.
One of the particle photons must define player 1, and the other particle photon must define player 2.
Comment out or remove the define statement for either player 1 and player 2, and ensure player 1 or player
2 isn't defined twice on both particle photons.
